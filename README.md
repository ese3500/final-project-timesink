## Final Project Proposal

### 1. Abstract

Our final project is TimeSink, an all-in-one tool to handle common bathroom needs, reducing clutter on valuable sink counter real estate while offering a variety of useful features in one place.

### 2. Motivation

Bathroom counters can be subject to some of the most pressing space constraints out of any place in the home. It can often be a daunting challenge to iterate on and settle on an arrangement of various home products like toothbrushes, toothpaste, and soap that conserves space while maintaining convenience. Additionally, the sink itself does little in the way of active assistance to the user, with no built-in functionality like lights or clocks. All of these issues combined can often result in the perfect storm, conspiring against users to leave the bathroom sink counter disorganized, unclean, and messy. 

We believe that TimeSink can help people organize their bathroom sink counter like never before. We want to make it easy to store and access the 20% of items and tools that will be used 80% of the time in a bathroom setting, including soap dispensing, nightlight, weather sync and time sync. We want our device to reduce cognitive load in critical times such as the morning rush or before bedtime and and help users establish a rhythm for their routines.

### 3. Goals

1. We want a digital display with current time and weather from WiFi.
2. We want an automatic soap dispenser.
3. We want the device to have user input for WiFi configuration.
4. We want to have a proximity-activated night light
5. We want the device to be wall-chargable.
6. We want to have a toothbrush holder with gravity-based moisture removal.
7. We want the product to fit within 4x4 inch maximum base dimensions.
8. We want the device to be waterproof.

### 4. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

**SRS 1.** Software shall be written in C for ATmega328PB microcontrollers.

### 6. MVP Demo

1. Dispenser firmware and hardware model (servo and photoresistor)
2. API calls with ESP32 Feather
3. UART between Feather and ATMega328PB
4. Weather info on ATmega328PB
5. Proximity light firmware and hardware model (ultrasonic sensor and LED)

### 7. Final Demo

1. GUI for WiFi connection and location selection, controlled with buttons
2. Photoresistor for external light detection to deactivate night light
3. Time information displayed on LCD
4. 3D printed Housing with toothbrush/toothpaste holder
5. Waterproofing with sealant
6. 1 hr updates/resync of data
7. LCD displays triggered actions (night light, soap)
8. Organized wiring and power delivery in one box

### 8. Methodology

We would like to 3D print a frame and housing for each of the components. Ideally, each would have their own compartments/sections in the superstructure for easy assembly. However, each component would essentially be independent, consisting of its own sensor/actuator pair. For example, a dispenser is composed of an ultrasonic sensor to detect proximity of hand or toothbrush, and a motor-based actuator to dispense the required substance.

### 3. Results

Our final device is a 6-by-6 inch base cardboard box that houses a soap dispenser, toothbrush storage space, a display with current time and weather synced with user configured WiFi, and a nightlight activated by motion sensor.

Our final implementation involved 2 separate systems powered by the same 5 VDC supply. One system was responsible for managing the soap dispenser and nightlight, while the other was responsible for mana

### 4. Conclusion

Reflect on your project. Some questions to consider: What did you learn from it? What went well? What accomplishments are you proud of? What did you learn/gain from this experience? Did you have to change your approach? What could have been done differently? Did you encounter obstacles that you didnâ€™t anticipate? What could be a next step for this project?

#### Successes
Our f

#### Shortcomings
The internals of the project could have used improvement in both design and implementation. For one, we likely could have used one ATmega328PB to handle both the connections to the peripheral sensors/actuators as well as the WiFi and display components. Not doing this meant we needed to accomodate extra room for both microcontrollers and power them in a less uniform manner. This ultimately resulted in disorganized internal wiring that was difficult to fit inside the housing.

In terms of the overall build quality, the project suffered due to scheduling issues and time pressure. We didn't understand the time constraints requirements of our 3D printing job. By the time we were finished with our design, we had assumed that we would be able to get it printed within a day or two. However, the size (which probably would have been reduced had we used one less microcontroller) meant that we couldn't print our design at RPL, and Education Commons was closed that week for Penn Relays, which left us with to Tangen Hall where the queues were too long for us to make the project deadline. Due to these issues, we ultimately decided to go with a cardboard box to contain the electronics, which would not meet our waterproofing specifications for the final design but would allow us to gather our electronics and at least present a self-contained device.

In the circuit implementations, we did finalize some connections by sautering wires to a perfboard, but overall the organization could have been much cleaner and more compact. We also had some issues with common grounding that caused some debugging pains. We also could have picked more applicable sensors 



#### Lessons Learned

#### Next Steps
Next steps for this project would involve meeting the unmet hardware and software requirements relevant to the project goals. This would mean re-assembling the project in the 3D printed shell and moving the code in the ATmega328PBs into a single microcontroller for space efficiency. We would then waterproof the device so that it can be used in a standard bathroom setting with extremely low risk. We might also want to switch out the photoresistor-LED pair for hand detection with another form of motion detection, like a small ultrasonic sensor or a PIR motion detector like the nightlight. This could reduce long-term power consumption.

Some additional considerations that we could consider involve the considerations about the consumer experience using the device. For example, we could look to use the ATmega328PB to turn off the WiFi module when it is not being used, storing login details entirely in memory and rebooting the module only when a refresh is needed. This would make the device more suited for its role with lower power consumption. The user interface could also be improved, with the configuration tools being in a less visible spot for a cleaner design and the interface being redesigned to have larger text and more intuitive instructions.

In a final product, we might consider improvements like only activating the LCD when motion is detected and reducing the size further, as well as improving the efficiency of requests on the WiFi side by reducing dependence on various APIs.
